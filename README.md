# Agentic Equity Analyst

**Status:** Prototype / Educational Sandbox
**Author:** Reid Caulder

## Overview
Agentic-Equity-Analyst is an autonomous AI system designed to automate the fundamental equity research process.

In traditional finance, a junior analyst spends hours scraping 10-Ks, reading news, and synthesizing risk factors. This project demonstrates how **Agentic AI** can streamline this workflow by deploying a team of specialized agents to perform these tasks in parallel, delivering a comprehensive investment memo in minutes.

## Business Use Case
This tool serves as a proof-of-concept for **GenAI Business Solutions**, specifically:
1.  **Automated Due Diligence:** Rapidly screening stocks for red flags.
2.  **Standardized Reporting:** Ensuring every analysis follows a strict, consistent framework.
3.  **Risk/Reward Synthesis:** Using separate agent roles to force a debate between growth potential and downside risk.
